## 🔧 Coding Standards

### Backend (Django/Python)

#### Code Style
```python
# Follow PEP 8 guidelines
# Use Black for code formatting
# Maximum line length: 88 characters

# Good example
class VehicleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for Vehicle model with nested relationships."""
    
    category = CategorySerializer(read_only=True)
    features = FeatureSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Vehicle
        fields = [
            'id', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'category',
            'daily_rate', 'features', 'is_available'
        ]
        read_only_fields = ['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at']
```

#### API Design
```python
# RESTful URL patterns
urlpatterns = [
    path('vehicles/', VehicleListCreateView.as_view(), name='vehicle-list'),
    path('vehicles/<int:pk>/', VehicleDetailView.as_view(), name='vehicle-detail'),
    path('vehicles/<int:pk>/availability/', VehicleAvailabilityView.as_view()),
]

# Consistent response format
def success_response(data, status_code=200, meta=None):
    return Response({
        'success': True,
        'data': data,
        'meta': meta or {},
        'errors': None
    }, status=status_code)
```

#### Testing Standards
```python
class VehicleAPITestCase(APITestCase):
    """Test cases for Vehicle API endpoints."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            email='test@example.com',
            password='testpass123'
        )
        self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.user)
    
    def test_list_vehicles_success(self):
        """Test successful vehicle listing."""
        response = self.client.get('/api/vehicles/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTrue(response.data['success'])
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Use functional components with hooks
// Implement proper TypeScript typing
// Follow React best practices

interface VehicleCardProps {
  vehicle: Vehicle;
  onSelect: (vehicle: Vehicle) => void;
  className?: string;
}

export const VehicleCard: React.FC<VehicleCardProps> = ({
  vehicle,
  onSelect,
  className = ''
}) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onSelect(vehicle);
  }, [vehicle, onSelect]);

  return (
    <div 
      className={`vehicle-card ${className}`}
      onClick={handleClick}
      role="button"
      tabIndex={0}
      aria-label={`Select ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}`}
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Use React Query for server state
const useVehicles = (filters: VehicleFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['vehicles', filters],
    queryFn: () => vehicleService.getVehicles(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  });
};

// Use Context for global client state
interface AppContextType {
  user: User | null;
  setUser: (user: User | null) => void;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  setTheme: (theme: 'light' | 'dark') => void;
}
```

#### Testing Standards
```typescript
describe('VehicleCard', () => {
  const mockVehicle: Vehicle = {
    id: 1,
    make: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Camry',
    year: 2023,
    daily_rate: 50.00
  };

  it('renders vehicle information correctly', () => {
    const onSelect = jest.fn();
    render(<VehicleCard vehicle={mockVehicle} onSelect={onSelect} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Toyota Camry')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('$50.00/day')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onSelect when clicked', () => {
    const onSelect = jest.fn();
    render(<VehicleCard vehicle={mockVehicle} onSelect={onSelect} />);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(onSelect).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockVehicle);
  });
});
```
